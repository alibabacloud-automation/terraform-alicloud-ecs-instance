# These dependencies are not directly required by terratest, but are defined here to directly hook them up so that they
# are version locked when it is pulled in by projects depending on terratest.
# This is necessary because kubernetes apimachinery and client-go do not support dep natively, and so overrides are
# necessary to make it work.
