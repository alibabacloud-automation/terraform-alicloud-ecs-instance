# Terraform Backend Example

This folder contains a simple Terraform module that demonstrates how you can use Terratest to configure a [Terraform 
Backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/) at test time. This module doesn't really do anything other than set 
up S3 as a backend, and allow Terratest to fill in that backend's configuration.

Check out [test/terraform_backend_example_test.go](/test/terraform_backend_example_test.go) to see how you can write
automated tests for this module.

**WARNING**: This module and the automated tests for it deploy real resources into your AWS account which can cost you
money. The resources are all part of the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), so if you haven't used that up,
it should be free, but you are completely responsible for all AWS charges.
